The Above is a project done by me.
The main aim of the project was to automate generation of development triangle,ratio triangle and the filling up the triangle to get ultimate costs.
The project also contains attempts to integrate statistical fitting in generating age-to-age factors.
The data sets were pre processed using the pre processing code:
Link of the dataset:https://www.casact.org/sites/default/files/2021-04/comauto_pos.csv.
Good datasets consists of companies who have more than 50 rows of data
Ok datasets consists of companies who have data more than 20 rows but below 50.
Final datasets consists of all data, the initial however consists of data till dev year 1997.
The main aim was to compare the try to convert the initial data into final dataset via method.
There is also a attempt to use machine learning in the project.
